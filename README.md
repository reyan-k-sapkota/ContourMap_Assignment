# ContourMap_Assignment
This is an automation script that generates a contour map for the respective first Index Contour's RL [initial RL is based on one's unique campus Roll Number]. The 5x5 RL Grid and instructions that were assigned to us as Homework Assignments by the Survey Instruction Committee (of IOE Pulchowk Campus) have been uploaded alongside the code.
