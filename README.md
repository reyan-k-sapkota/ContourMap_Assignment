# ContourMap_Assignment
This is an automation script that is used to generate contour map for respective first Index Contour's RL [initial RL is based on one's unique campus Roll Number]. The 5x5 RL Grid and instructions that had been assigned to us as an Homework Assignment by Survey Instruction Committee (of IOE Pulchowk Campus) has been uploaded alongside the code.
